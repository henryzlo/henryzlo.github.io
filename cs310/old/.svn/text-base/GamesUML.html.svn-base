    <h1>UML Class Diagram for Games Project</h1>
    <h4>created by Oracle JDeveloper</h4>
    <p>Note: add Game &lt;&gt;---&gt;Move aggregation implied by
      Iterator&lt;Move&gt; supplied by Game.<br>
      Note that labels "one", "two", and "g" should be closer to the
      arrowheads of their HAS-A relationship arrows,<br>
      and that these are the field names in AbstractPlayOneGame, and
      thus represent the view of these objects <br>
      from AbstractPlayOneGame. Also note - for private, + for public
      fields and methods.<br>
    </p>
    <p>PlayGame sets up the object graph corresponding to this class
      diagram, sketched in class.<br>
