CS105 Homework 3

Instructions: Please print or write your answers LEGIBLY, and turn in a hard copy of the assignment in class next Friday.

1. Sorting:

  a. In the best case, which is faster, mergesort or bubblesort?  What is this case?
  b. In the worst case, which is faster, mergesort or bubblesort?  What is this case?
  c. How many times will mergesort split an array with 43 elements? (hint: how many times can you divide 43 by 2 (rounding up) before you get to 1?)

2. Big-O:

  a. What is O(5n^3 + 3n + 8) =?
  b. What is O(99999999999999999) =?
  c. Suppose I have a O(n^2) algorithm.  Is this slower or faster than a O(n) algorithm?  Does it perform fewer or more computations?
  d. Suppose I have a O(n*log(n)) algorithm.  Is this slower or faster than a O(n^2) algorithm?  Does it perform fewer or more computations?

3. Data structures:

  a. Provide an example of a stack that we did not go over in class.
  b. Provide an example of a queue that we did not go over in class.  Please do not say a waiting line.
  c. Provide an example of a graph that we did not go over in class.
  d. Provide an example of a tree that we did not go over in class.
