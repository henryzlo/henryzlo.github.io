CS105 Homework 4

Instructions: Please print or write your answers LEGIBLY, and turn in a hard copy of the assignment in class.

1. Searching in arrays:

  a. If we just want to search an unsorted array once, what is more efficient, binary search or linear search, and why?
  b. In the worst case, how many steps will a linear search on an array of 36 elements take?
  c. In the worst case, how many steps will a binary search on an array of 36 elements take?

2. Searching in trees/graphs:

  a. If you know the element is near the root, which would you use, DFS or BFS?
  b. What is better about DFS than BFS?  What is better about DFS than BFS?
  c. Assume that while depth-first searching a graph, we traverse cycles.  That is, we ignore whether or not we have already visited a node.  What will happen?

3. Graph traversal:

  a. Using Dijkstra's algorithm, you have visited all the neighbors of node a.  You have not yet visited node b, which is 4 meters away, node c, which is 3 meters away, and node d, which is 8 meters away.  Which node do you visit after a?
  b. The current path to node d is 10 meters, but you have found another path leads to d in 7 meters.  How do you update the distance table?
  c. Assume in Dijkstra's algorithm, you encounter an edge with a very large negative weight.  What would happen?
  d. Is the brute force algorithm slower or faster than an O(n^4) algorithm?
