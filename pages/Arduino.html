    <h1>Arduino Basics</h1>
    <p>
      The best way to learn programming.  The <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
      makes the distinct excitement of affecting the *physical* world through code
      accessible to newcomers.  In this post, we introduce programming the Arduino
      via simple applications utilizing I/O devices like sensors, speakers, lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      These demos were presented at the
      <a href="http://josephpcohen.com/fosshackinginnovation/index.html">FOSS/Hacking/Innovation event</a>
      at the Boston Museum of Science.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <img src="img/arduino_ide.png"/>

    <p>
      We go over the basics of programming the Arduino via example projects.  This
      tutorial should be accessible by itself, but if you want to follow along, you
      will need the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	an Arduino board (the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Uno</a>
	is a good start)
      </li><li>
	the Arduino <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">software</a> (see right)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    This tutorial will cover the following projects, which each have their own 
    hardware requirements:

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>blink</code>, an LED turning on and off (originally from Arduino examples)
      </li><li>
	<code>pressure</code>, a sensor which lights 4 LEDs depending on pressure applied
      </li><li>
	<code>rangefinder</code>, a sensor which outputs to a seven segment display distance in
	feet
      </li><li>
	<code>soundboard</code>, a keypad which drives a speaker to say different phrases
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Blink Demo</h2>
    
    <img width="500px" src="img/arduino_blink.jpg"/>

    <p>
      You can find <code>blink</code> in the Arduino software examples, or copy it from the
      code below.  This sketch introduces the basic overview of an Arduino
      program, and how to do output.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simple sketch repeatedly turns an LED on and off.  The <code>blink</code> program
      requires an LED with the <code>+</code> end (shaped like a hook) plugged in digital pin
      10, and the <code>-</code> end (the larger head) attached to the GND pin.  See left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When attached correctly, you can upload the following code
      <a href="code/blink.pde">blink.pde</a>
      to continuously blink the LED:
    </p>
    <pre>
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(10, HIGH);    // turn the LED on (HIGH voltage)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(10, LOW);     // turn the LED off (LOW voltage)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
</pre>

    All Arduino programs require two functions:

    <ul>
      <li>
	<code>setup</code>, which runs once.
      </li><li>
	<code>loop</code>, which runs continually.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      In this sketch, <code>setup</code> sets digital pin 10 to <code>OUTPUT</code> using the <code>pinMode</code>
      function.  This sets pin 10 to provide power, rather than detecting signal
      (<code>INPUT</code>).  This only needs to happen once.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some Arduino models initialize pins to <code>INPUT</code>, but it's good to always set
      a pin's mode to be sure.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the <code>loop</code>, <code>digitalWrite</code> sends from pin 10 a high-volt signal to the <code>+</code>
      end of the LED.  This lights up the LED.  The Arduino then pauses for one
      second before sending a low-volt signal, which is not enough to light the LED.
      The board then pauses again, before repeating indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>digitalWrite</code>, <code>pinMode</code>, <code>HIGH</code>, <code>LOW</code>, <code>delay</code> are all defined in the
      <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">Arduino documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Pressure Demo</h2>

    <p>
      The <code>pressure</code> demo consists of programming four LEDs to measure force on a
      pressure sensor.  This example will demonstrate how to handle input and
      organize circuitry with a breadboard.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Constructing the Circuit</h3>
    
    To follow along, you will need the following:
    
    <ul>
      <li>
	4 LEDs
      </li><li>
	5 male to male jumper wires (for LEDs and ground)
      </li><li>
	Breadboard
      </li><li>
	Pressure sensor (tested on the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11207">Flexiforce 25 lb.</a>, but any one will do)
      </li><li>
	2 female to male jumper wires (for sensor, other models may have different requirements)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <img width="500px" src="img/arduino_breadboard.jpg"/>
    
    <p>
      Each LED requires a connection to ground, but there is only one GND pin.  This
      can be resolved by connecting GND to a vertical power rail with a male-to-male
      wire.  These rails lie on either side of the breadboard; red arrows on the
      image on the right (from a <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard">Sparkfun tutorial</a>) show the underlying connections of the rails. This allows the power rail to serve as ground for any component connected to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the circuit should be organized as follows:
    </p>    

    <ul>
      <li>
	Connect each LED to the ground rail, with the other end in different horizontal row.
      </li><li>
	In each of these rows, connect a male end of a male-male jumper cable.
      </li><li>
	Connect the other end of the jumper cables to digital pins 2, 3, 4, and 5.
      </li><li>
	Attach the female end of the remaining cables to the sensor, with one female
	end to the ground rail and one end to analog pin 0.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Program</h3>
    
    <p>
      <code>setup</code> initializes each LED pin mode to <code>OUTPUT</code> as in <code>blink</code>.  Here we use a
      global array to store which pins are connected to LEDs and loop through them in
      <code>setup</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>loop</code> first calculates the pressure.  For our sensor, this is inversely related
      to the signal received.  <code>analogRead</code> gets the signal as a <code>float</code>, which we
      invert and  average over 60 readings to obtain a <code>pressure</code> value.  Analog pins can only be used for <code>INPUT</code>, so we do not need to set pin
      mode.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, <code>loop</code> compares <code>pressure</code> with each value in <code>thresholds</code>.  If pressure
      exceeds the first threshold, the first LED is lit; each LED has its own threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code (<a href="code/pressure.ino">pressure.ino</a>):
    </p>
<pre>
int pressurePin = 0;
int ledPins[] = {2, 3, 4, 5};
float thresholds[] = {0.04, 0.2, 1.0, 2.2};

void setup()
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    pinMode(ledPins[i], OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop()
{
  float pressure;
  // Average to get more accurate readings
  for (int i = 0; i < 60 ; i++) {
    // the stronger the pressure, the lower the input
    pressure += 1 / analogRead(pressurePin);
    delay(5);
  }
  pressure = pressure / 60;
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    if (pressure >= thresholds[i]) {
      digitalWrite(ledPins[i], HIGH);
    } else {
      digitalWrite(ledPins[i], LOW);
    }
  }
  delay(500);
}
</pre>

    <p>
      When uploaded, the LEDs will light up according to how much pressure is applied
      to the sensor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>thresholds</code> may need to be calibrated.  For this, the serial monitor in the
      Arduino IDE may prove useful.  To use the monitor, insert <code>Serial.begin(9600);</code>
      to set the baud rate in <code>setup</code>, then <code>Serial.println(pressure);</code> in <code>loop</code>
      after calculating <code>pressure</code> to see its value.
    </p>

    <h2>Rangefinder Demo</h2>
    <p>
      This demo calculates distance in feet using an infrared rangefinder and
      uses a seven segment display (SSD) as output.
    </p>

    <h3>Constructing the Circuit</h3>

    <p>
      To follow along, you will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Seven segment display (tested on the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8546">China Young Sun YSD-160AR4B-8</a>)
      </li><li>
	9 male to male jumper wires (for SSD and power rails)
      </li><li>
	Breadboard
      </li><li>
	Rangefinder (tested on the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11307">HRLV-MaxSonar-EZ0</a>)
      </li><li>
	3 male jumper cables, with the other end stripped off (for rangefinder)
      </li><li>
	Optional: solder and soldering iron (alternatively, use 3 male jumper cables with clips)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <img src="img/arduino_ssd.jpg"/>
    <p>
      Both the rangefinder and SSD require additional power.  The Arduino
      has a 5V pin which provides this power; connect this to the
      breadboard power rail with a male-to-male wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The SSD should be placed on the breadboard so that its bottom and top parts span
      the gap in the middle.  Five male-male wires should be inserted above the SSD
      and four below (two on either side, with a gap in the middle).  These wires
      should be connected to the pins numbered in the diagram on the right.
    </p>
    <img width="500px" src="img/arduino_maxbotix.jpg"/>
    <p>
      For the rangefinder, attached the 3 stripped cable ends (or ends with clips, as
      shown left) to the holes labeled GND, +5, and AN.  The other ends should be
      plugged into the GND pin, power rail, and analog 0, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting circuit should connect the rangefinder and SSD to power, the
      seven pins of the SSD to seven digital pins, and the rangefinder to analog 0
      and GND.
    </p>

    <h3>Program</h3>
    <p>
      This program is divided into a main file
      (<a href="code/rangefinder.ino">rangefinder.ino</a>) and two header files
      (<a href="code/range.h">range.h</a>) and (<a href="code/ssd.h">ssd.h</a>).  The main
      program:
    </p>    
    <pre>
#include "ssd.h"
#include "range.h"

// This demo prints distance in inches to a 7-segment display
void setup() {
  setupSSD();
}

void loop() {
  int output = getRange(0);
  displayNumber(output);
  delay(1000);
}
</pre>

    <p>
      The <code>setup</code> function sets the SSD digital pins to <code>OUTPUT</code>.  The rangefinder is
      analog, and thus can only be in <code>INPUT</code> mode.  In <code>loop</code>, the Arduino
      continually polls the distance to the target in inches and displays it on the
      SSD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>getRange</code> function is defined in <code>range.h</code>, shown below.  It averages over
      sixy readings.  The division by 2 is needed to scale the analog reading into
      inches (see <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MaxSonar">this</a> for an in-depth
      explanation).
    </p>
    <pre>
#include <Arduino.h>

float getRange(int pin) {
  // Returns distance to target in inches.
  pinMode(pin, INPUT);

  float distance = 0;
  // Average to get more accurate readings
  for (int i = 0; i < 60; i++) {
    // from http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MaxSonar
    distance += analogRead(pin) / 2;
    delay(10);
  }

  return(distance / 60);
}
</pre>

    <p>
      The <code>setupSSD</code> and <code>displayNumber</code> functions are defined in <code>ssd.h</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The file is too large to post here, but you can see it here
      <a href="code/ssd.h">ssd.h</a>.  As mentioned previously, <code>setupSSD</code> sets the
      SSD digital pins to <code>OUTPUT</code>.  <code>displayNumber</code> is a switch case statement
      which lights a subset of the seven segments (see SSD image) with <code>digitalWrite</code>;
      segments lit depend on the number desired.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Soundboard Demo</h2>

    This demo programs the Arduino to take in numeric keypad input.  Depending on
    the number selected, a different phrase is spoken by a speaker.  The speaker
    and keypad functionality are added via shields, which easily extend Arduino
    functionality.
    
    <h3>Constructing the Circuit</h3>

    To follow along, you will need:

    <ul>
      <li>
	Touchpad shield (available <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10508">here</a>)
      </li><li>
	VoiceBox shield (available <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10661">here</a>)
      </li><li>
	2 sets of Arduino stackable headers (make sure they are the right size for your Arduino)
      </li><li>
	Solder and soldering iron
      </li><li>
	Speakers or headphones
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <img width="500px" src="img/arduino_soundboard.jpg"/>
    <p>
      To assemble:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Solder the stackable headers onto the Touchpad shield and the VoiceBox shield.
	Take care not to solder together adjacent pins.
      </li><li>
	Stack the VoiceBox shield on top of the Arduino, putting the pins of the
	VoiceBox shield the slots of the Arduino.
      </li><li>
	Stack the Touchpad shield on top of the VoiceBox.
      </li><li>
	Attach speakers or headphones to the VoiceBox.
      </li>
    </ul>

    The completed device (with headphones) is shown in the picture.

    <h3>Program</h3>
    
    The program is again divided functionally into three components.

    <ul>
      <li>
	Main program, <a href="code/soundboard.ino">soundboard.ino</a>
      </li><li>
	Touchpad driver, <a href="code/touchpad.h">touchpad.h</a> (uses
	<a href="code/i2c.h">i2c.h</a>, <a href="code/mpr121.h">mpr121.h</a>,
	<a href="code/types.h">types.h</a>, <a href="code/defs.h">defs.h</a>,
	obtained from <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/Touch_Shield">Sparkfun's Github</a>
      </li><li>
	Speakjet driver, <a href="code/speak.h">speak.h</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    The main program is quite simple (some switch cases are omitted for brevity):

    <pre>
#include "touchpad.h"
#include "speak.h"
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

void setup()
{
  touchpadSetup();
  speakjetSetup();
}

void loop()
{
  int number = 0;
  while (number==0)
    number = getNumber();

  switch (number) {
    case 1:
      // Hello
      say("HE FAST EHLE LO OWWW");
      break;
    case 2:
      // I can speak
      say("OHIH P4 KE SLOW AY NE P4 SE PE SLOW IY EK");
      break;
    ...
    case 9:
      byte ping[] = {20, 96, 21, 114, 22, 88, 23, 5, 252};
      sound(ping);
      break;
  }
  delay(1000);
}
</pre>

    <p>
      As in <code>rangefinder</code>, there are setup functions for the Touchpad and Speakjet
      shields.  The loop first polls for a pressed number (<code>getNumber</code> returns 0 when
      no button is pressed).  A switch case then <code>say</code>s a phrase depending on which
      number is pressed, except for case 9, which calls the <code>sound</code> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase is encoded using a string of space-separated phonemes.  Looking into
      <code>say</code> in speak.h reveals that <code>say</code> merely encodes the phoneme string into a
      byte array, which is then passed into <code>sound</code>, which in turn calls
      <code>speakjet.print</code>.  Reprogramming a new phrase only involves looking up phonemes
      (page 16 of the
      <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/speakjet-usermanual.pdf">user manual</a>)
      and codes for things like stop and speeding up pronunciation (page 15).
    </p>
    <p>
      The code to make <code>getNumber</code> works is far more complicated; for more
      information, check out the
      <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10508">product page</a>.
