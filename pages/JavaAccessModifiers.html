    <h1>Java Access Modifiers</h1>
    All objects have a public face, which others can interact with, and
    private inner workings, which others should never touch.  <i>Access
    modifiers</i> are used to enforce how an object's members can be
    interacted with and by whom.  These keywords are integral to
    <i>encapsulating</i> an object's functionality and enforcing, and thus are
    commonly used in Java and other object-oriented languages.

    The Java access modifiers are <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, 
    <code>protected</code>, and
    package-private, which applies when no access modifier is explicitly
    stated.  These keywords can be applied any class members, whether
    attributes or methods; <code>public</code> and package-private can also be
    applied to classes.

    <h2>Public vs. Private</h2>
    
    Only members marked <code>public</code> can be interacted with by the outside
    world.  These methods and attributes are those which we want other
    classes to know about, and to use when interacting with the object.

    <code>private</code> members are hidden from the outside world, and accessing
    them from other classes results in a compile-time error.  Privacy is
    often used to hide implementation details, i.e. the functionality that
    a class needs to do its job, but that others do not need to know
    about.
    
    In object-oriented programming (OOP), it is considered best practice
    to make everything as private as possible.  This manages complexity by
    limiting the number of ways classes can interact.  This is the notion
    of <i>encapsulation</i>.

    <h2>Example: Employee</h2>

    Consider a class, <code>Employee</code>.  The application interacts with
    <code>Employee</code>s only by getting or setting their salaries.  There are two
    ways to design this:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Expose a <code>salary</code> attribute, which others can set or get
	directly.</li>
      <li>Expose <code>getSalary</code> and <code>setSalary</code> methods.</li>
    </ul>
    
    The difference is subtle.  The first approach allows direct access
    into the employee's <code>salary</code>, while the second allows <code>Employee</code> to
    control how the setting or getting happens.  For example, in
    <code>setSalary</code>, we can first check the salary is valid via
    <code>validateSalary</code>; this type of validation cannot be done within
    <code>Employee</code> in the simpler approach.

    In the OOP approach, all attributes are private.  To interact with
    <code>salary</code>, the application must use the public <code>getSalary</code> and
    <code>setSalary</code> methods (+ signs).
    
    The <code>validateSalary</code> method is also <code>private</code>. As it only exists to
    support the public functionality of <code>Employee</code>, and hence is only
    relevant to <code>Employee</code>, it does not need to be accessed anywhere else.
    
    Private members are not completely inaccessible to the outside world,
    but can only be accessed indirectly through the public functions.
    
    The code:
    
<pre>
public class Employee {
  private int salary;

  public int getSalary() {
    return salary;
  }

  public void setSalary(int s) {
    if (validateSalary(s)) 
      salary = s;
  }

  private boolean validateSalary(int s) {
    return s >= 0;
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Package Private and Protected</h2>


Having no access modifiers on a member makes in <i>package-private</i>,
which means that the member is public to all classes within the same
package, but private to everything outside of it.

Package-private is generally considered bad form, as there are few
use-cases for it.  

<code>protected</code> members are package-private members which are passed on to
<code>subclasses</code>.  Actual <code>private</code> members are hidden even from
subclasses, and do not get inherited.

In some situations though, it may be more elegant (though probably
poor OOP) to inherit <code>private</code> methods from a parent.  For example, if
we have multiple employees (say, a manager), and each has a different
method of validating salary, then it may make sense to override
<code>validateSalary</code> in the manager class.

<br/>

<br/>

In this UML diagram, <code>validateSalary</code> is changed to be <code>protected</code>,
and is overriden by the subclass <code>Manager</code>.  Now, setting the salary
for a <code>Manager</code> is done as follows:

<ul>
  <li>Call <code>setSalary</code> on a <code>Manager</code> object</li>
  <li>This calls <code>Employee</code>'s <code>setSalary</code> method</li>
  <li><code>setSalary</code> calls the overriden <code>validateSalary</code> in <code>Manager</code>.</li>
</ul>

This strategy introduces stronger dependencies between the two classes
than would otherwise be present if <code>Manager</code> were merely subclassing
<code>Employee</code>.  For this reason, <code>protected</code> is generally avoided and
considered bad OO practice.

The code (must change <code>setSalary</code> to <code>protected</code> in <code>Employee</code>):

<pre>
class Manager extends Employee {
  protected boolean validateSalary(int s) {
    return s > 40000;
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Members and Classes</h2>

There are two types of class members: attributes and methods.
Attributes are almost always <code>private</code>, as they are considered
implementation details.  How methods are affected by access modifiers
are summarized below:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Accessible from...</th>
      <th>Class</th>
      <th>Package</th>
      <th>Subclasses</th>
      <th>Everywhere</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>public</code></td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>protected</code></td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="negative">N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(default)</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="negative">N</td>
      <td class="negative">N</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>private</code></td>
      <td class="positive">Y</td>
      <td class="negative">N</td>
      <td class="negative">N</td>
      <td class="negative">N</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The access modifiers <code>public</code> and package-private can also apply to
classes and interfaces (<code>private</code> and <code>protected</code> make little sense in
this context).  This just specifies whether the class or interface can
be used from outside a package or not.
