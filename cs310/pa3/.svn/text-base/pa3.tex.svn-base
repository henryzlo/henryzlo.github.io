\section{Goals}
This assignment will help you with the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write a game-playing AI.
\item Learn the game package.
\item Review dynamic programming (memoization).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Overview}
You will write an intelligent AI for playing games in general.  There are several games in the \texttt{Game} package, but by writing a \texttt{Player} class, you will be able to play any of them in a general way.

You will need to fill in the \texttt{findBest} method in \texttt{Backtrack} to use the minimax algorithm to find the best move for the given player.  You will also write another player \texttt{Dynamic}, which does the same thing, but uses memoization to save computations.

\section{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Replace \texttt{findBest} in \texttt{Backtrack} in the cs310 folder, using a minimax algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
\item You may need a recursive subfunction to return ints, rather than moves. 
\item Remember to make moves on Game copies, so that you can backtrack. 
\item You will need to find out whose turn it is (\texttt{game.whoseTurn()}) to find the right move.
\end{itemize}
\item Use \texttt{PlayGame} to make sure your \texttt{Backtrack} player works, and write down times for several games.
\item Create another \texttt{Player} subclass called \texttt{Dynamic}, which memoizes results in the computation tree.
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a map to memoize results for subtrees.
\item Your code should look very similar to BackTrack.
\end{itemize}
\item Use \texttt{PlayGame} to test \texttt{Dynamic} and \texttt{Backtrack} for  several games.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Show that they perform the same moves.
\item Show that dynamic saves time.
\end{itemize}
\item Classes must compile.
\item Put all deliverables in your cs310/pa3 folder.  Deliverables include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Backtrack.java
\item Dynamic.java
\item memo.txt
\end{itemize}
\item Answer the questions in section 4, put answers in memo.txt.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Play 2 games (you choose which) with \texttt{Backtrack}, save the result.
\item Play the same two games with \texttt{Dynamic}.
\item Show the runtime difference between \texttt{Backtrack} and \texttt{Dynamic}.  Use games where this difference is noticeable.
\item Play two AI players against each other.
\end{enumerate}
