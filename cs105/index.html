<h2>Official Course Description:</h2>
<p>
This course presents an overview of the role of computers in society -- their 
application and misapplication, their capabilities and limitations. 
Applications may include artificial intelligence, medical, aerospace and 
business uses of computers. Computer hardware and associated technologies 
will be discussed. Computer programming will be taught from a non-mathematical,
problem-solving point of view, the objective being an understanding of the 
programming process, rather than the development of complex or extended 
computer programs. This survey course is not part of the computer science major
sequence. Students planning to major in computer science should start with 
CS110 or CS114L.
