<h1>Hardware</h1>

We learn the parts of a computer.  This may be useful in case you need to upgrade / repair your PC!

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is the inside of a computer:<br/>
    <img src="http://www.crossaction.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/anatomy-of-a-compuer.gif"/>
    <ul>
      <li>The case containing everything is called the chassis.</li>
      <li>The motherboard is the big blue chip, which everything else connects to.</li>
      <li>The PSU (thing on the top left) is the power supply.</li>
      <li>On the right side of this picture, there are "rails" for mounting hard drives (on the bottom) and CD / DVD drives (on the top).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Pieces of the Computer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The power supply unit (PSU) converts the wall AC to DC for the computer.
    <ul>
      <li>The hard drives, CD drives, motherboard, and graphics card all receive power from the PSU.</li>
      <li>There is always a 20 pin connector (see bottom right of picture) which connects to the motherboard.</li>
      <li>PSU's vary in wattage.  Several hundred watts are enough to power regular computers.<br>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The motherboard is what everything connects to.
    <ul>
      <li>Motherboard houses the RAM, CPU and its fan, and connectors to the IDEs (CD / DVD drives, hard disks).</li>
      <li>It also contains several PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) slots for cards.</li>
      <li>Cards may be sound cards, wireless cards, etc.  They add functionality to the computer.</li>
      <li>There is also a special PCI-express slot especially for graphics cards.</li>
      <li>There are connectors to input / outputs, such as power buttons, keyboard, mouse, internet, monitor, etc. (connectors for integrated peripherals in the picture below)<br/>

      </li>
      <li>Finally, the motherboard contains the BIOS, the built-in operating system, which runs first.</li>
      <li>The BIOS loads the operating system from the hard disk into RAM at boot time.</li>
      <li>It also keeps track of all devices connected to the computer, e.g. RAM, CD / Hard drives.<br/>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mounted on the motherboard is a CPU, along with its heatsink and fan, which all serve to cool the CPU.
    <ul>
      <li>On the top is a fan.</li>
      <li>Below the fan is a grooved metal piece called the heatsink.</li>
      <li>The heatsink has many grooves, which maximize contact with the air, allowing it to cool faster.
      <br/>

      </li>
      <li>Below the heatsink is the CPU, mounted on the motherboard.</li>
      <li>The CPU and heatsink are connected using a glue called thermal paste, whichhelps thermal conductivity.</li>
      <li>CPUs perform most of the computations in the computer, and are measured in gigahertz for speed.</li>
      <li>CPUs can have multiple cores, which means they can perform multiple simultaneous computations (e.g. playing music and browsing the internet at the same time).<br/>

      </li>
      <li>Different CPU families require different motehrboards</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>RAM is mounted on the motherboard, and stores program memory.
    <ul>
      <li>RAM: random access memory.  Kind of like short-term memory.</li>
      <li>All running programs are loaded into RAM in order to run.</li>
      <li>The BIOS loads the operating system into RAM during boot.</li>
      <li>RAM comes in different varieties - current standard for desktop is DDR3.</li>
      <li>RAM is not backwards compatible - different types of RAM require different motherboards.<br/>

</ul>

<h2>Integrated Drive Electronics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>IDEs consist of hard drives and optical disk drives (CD / DVD / Bluray)
    <ul>
      <li>These connect to the motherboard.</li>
      <li>Old standard is PATA (fat cables), new standard is SATA (red cable).</li>
      <li>Different IDE connector requires different motherboard (some support both) <br/>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CD / DVD drives are IDE drives.
    <ul>
      <li>They read / write CD / DVD's using a laser.</li>
      <li>When writing, the laser carves grooves into the acrylic CD, like a record.</li>
      <li>The head, which contains the laser, moves between the inside and outside of the CD. <br/>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hard disks are IDE drives which store information persistently.
    <ul>
      <li>Unlike RAM, which gets reset every time the computer turns off, data written to hard disks stay indefinitely.</li>
      <li>There is an actual disk, like a CD, which holds the information.</li>
      <li>However, the disk is written magnetically - there is a magnetic head instead of a laser.<br/>
